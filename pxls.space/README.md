# pxls.space themes

- all of these were made with chrome and stylus in mind
- they're userstyles, all using a preprocessor (stylus (and less for some reason))
- i tried to make them work with all of pxls's themes
- chat, settings, sidebars etc. are unthemed intentionally

## Place 17
- meant to be used at zoom level 40
- a toggle for tilting the pixel preview when moving the cursor around - only works on chromium-based browsers and is laggy because of course it is
  - disabled by default
- also has a toggle for 'locking' the palette while on a cooldown - only works on chromium-based browsers because of firefox's weird `:has()` implementation
  - enabled by default
  - kinda broken unless you have palette stacking enabled. i'm too lazy to fix it so if someone wants to fix it open a pr or something idk

## Place 22
- has a variable for column count because i was too lazy to figure out a better way to do this
- also has an alt variant for the info box on the bottom left
- themes the mod tools

## Place 23
- idk what to say about this one lol
- it shares a lot of css with the place 22 theme
- yes, mod tools are themed

## 11pixels's concept
- based on a concept i made some time ago
- pixel preview is broken on firefox (it should enlarge when pressed but doesn't and i may have a skill issue because i couldn't figure out how to fix it)
- also, to a smaller extent, themes mod tools
