# DTM-08 Rewrite
This is a currently work-in-progress rewrite of DTM-08 in SCSS with some tweaks.

Currently there is no support for light mode and there are a *lot* of unthemed elements, please don't open issues regarding this rewrite, unless they're suggestions and not "this thing isn't themed or is broken".

The theme version can be found below the logout button in user settings, above Discord's version text.
