[Skeucord Legacy](/Other/Skeucord-Legacy/) | a recreation of the oldest surviving iteration of DTM-08 (from late 2017), which was originally known as Skeucord. may or may not eventually be turned into a proper theme, but currently serves as nothing more than a "here's where it all started".
[NewDragNDropModal](/Other/NewDragNDropModal/) | overhauls the drag-and-drop file upload modal
[OldProfileUI](/Other/OldProfileUI.theme.css) | brings back the pre-profile themes version of the profile ui
