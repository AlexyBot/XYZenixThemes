## Contributing
if you want to contribute, you can open pull requests i guess

for dtm-16 and dtm-17, pull requests should be modifying the .scss file, don't compile it yourself, i'll do it instead (so hopefully it doesn't create a mess of merge conflicts)

for dtm-08, there's just a .css file

the rest of the themes aren't really worth contributing to but if you really want to, go ahead, all of them should be just .css and no scss/sass
